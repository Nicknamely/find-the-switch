# Find The Switch - frontend project
---
This game is a challenge I made for myself after I saw one of my seniors project.

## Introduction:

It's sunday and you are chilling on your sofa - it's 3 am.
Sudently lights go off and it has become pitch dark. Fortunately your emergency generator kicks in.
(For plot's sake, let's assume all switch are off - somehow ðŸ˜…)

You goal is to find all the switch across the room and turn them on.

Shity plot but idc.
